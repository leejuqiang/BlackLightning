# BlackLightning
This project is an open source unity3D project. It's a game and contains a framework I called "LGUI". This framework is developed to help indie game developers using unity3D.

The document of this framework will be added soon. It's called "LGUI" but it's not just for gui, it contains some other areas.
Most of the code I have tested, but I won't assure bug free, so if you find any likely bug, you can email me(leejuqiang@gmail.com) and I will check it.
